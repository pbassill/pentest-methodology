# Enumeration
Enumeration is the stage where we attempt to collect as much information as we can from the host before even trying to exploit anything. I will easily spend 1-2 hours of enumeration on a medium box. Take your time with this step, never rush this. Go very slow, read everything, save anything and everything in your notes that might be relevant later.
